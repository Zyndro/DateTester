# DateTester

Testing of a https://codebeautify.org/generate-random-date date generator.
Test "database" in /Dates folder contains a 1000 randomly generated dates for each available preset, and some basic tests for custom format

Since this generator has no api available(and the generation is done locally in browser) im not going to bother with generating the data "live" and scraping it with the test scripts.
